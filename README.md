fileSPLIT
=========

splitting large files into smaller pieces – for better transportation ...

 

fileSPLIT splits large files into smaller pieces of maximum size to be able to
transport them, for example by CD, DVD or USB-stick. At the target system, the
file pieces are reunited by the automatically created DOS script "melt.bat" and
you receive the original file. fileSPLIT does not need to be installed on the
target system.
