This file (location.portable.txt) is used to indicate that 
the application is running in portable mode. If this file 
is found in the application's folder, all config and data 
will be stored in the program folder itself, rather than 
in the users home directory.

The contents of this file are irrelevant. It could
also be completely empty. It is only checked if
there is a file "location.portable.txt" or not.
